* Selector colors in colors directory are used for state based colors.
    * Order matters while comparing for any state.
    * Api 23, ref attributes is added.
    * Api 21 alpha modulation is added. Useful to set variations of theme refs like (0.25 alpha, colorPrimary)
    * Color state list wont work on api < 10 for image view background because ColorStateDrawables are created on Api 10.(Use backgroundTint)

* Naming
    * Do not name with semantic meaning(colorPrimary, colorSecondary).
    * Name with literals. (Brand_blue, brand_red, blue_200)
